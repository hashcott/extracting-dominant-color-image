## But how do K-Means Clustering works?

Letâ€™s say you have some vector XX that contains nn data points. Running our algorithm consists of the following steps:

- Take random kk points (called centroids) from XX
- Assign every point to the closest centroid. The newly formed bunch of points is called cluster.
- For each cluster, find new centroid by calculating a new center from the points
- Repeat steps 2-3 until centroids stop changing
